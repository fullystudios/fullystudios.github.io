  Even though it sounds like plain balderdash, summer is the busiest season for hockey sales. And this summer, hockey heavyweight Bauer had three brand new products to release. Lucky for us, our friends at The Bond asked us to help out with the campaign.

  ## Smooth with some slo-mo

  “When you are fast, everything else seems slow” was the tagline for the campaign. So obviously this was something our solution needed to reflect. A fast and witty quiz, with a nifty slo-mo game mechanic, was our way to tackle this demand (yes, pun intended).

  We didn’t treat the experience as a quiz per se, but rather as a game. Meaning that the players could rank up in tiers, use power-ups, explore mini-games, all while answering a flurry of tricky questions.

  Animations was also a big part of making the quiz exciting. A lot of focus was put into creating a smooth and fun UI, accompanied by the cheers and boos from the sound effects.

  Crusner, a legal firm in Sweden, is on a mission to change what it means to “see a lawyer.” 

  They set out to create democratized mobile service, where people can get legal services from certified lawyers — without having to leave the comfort and convenience of their own home or office. 

  That’s where we came in. To make this brilliant idea a technological reality. 

section1: |
  ## A new service for the legal world

  Rätt is an app for making video calls with a lawyer. This in itself is an industry-disrupting move. Suddenly anyone, regardless of geography, can see a lawyer whenever they might need to. 

  Because it broadens the playing field so much, it was important that the app would make the journey of consulting a lawyer and arranging legal documents both understandable and pleasant. The UX needed to be above-and-beyond thoughtful.

  The technology also needed to accommodate whichever kind of device a legal-advice-seeking person might be using at the time. We developed a single API “brain” that sends and receives information from iOs, Android, and the web. We started by coding a webapp in React and then translated it to React native apps. Meaning: you can use Rätt if you’re on your laptop, an iPhone in your car, or a Samsung tablet at your kitchen table. It’s available both as an app and a service you can simply log into via a website.

  ## Start small. Think big.

  How can we guide users through complex legal terms and questions in an elegant, easy way? 

  Our answer was: we can get close to the best solutions, but it is user input that will result in the most value for the people that use Rätt. 

  We focused on building a rock-solid product with the infrastructure in place to scale up. This didn’t mean making a barebones app though — no, no — our goal was to create a Minimum Loveable Product. An MLP endeavors to accrue a gang of very happy repeat users who spread the word over time. While that’s happening organically, we test test test!

  ## Easy for clients, easy for lawyers

  Together with Crusner, we put a lot of work into user experience design and user flows. Because it was such a complicated system, we were diligent in documenting user flows so the technical solutions would be easy to survey and make improvements upon. 


section4: |
  The heart of the whole service is the video call. We tailor-made a solution that works seamlessly in both the client part of the app as well as the lawyer view. 

section5: |
  In the app, clients use their profile page where new, ongoing, and archived cases are stored. There is a log where they can follow each step of their legal case and access associated documents at any time. On the lawyer’s end, they have their own login and they can choose to assign themselves to cases and take video calls. The call itself has a log for the specific case with all the information provided from the client.

section6: |
  ## Serious but approachable

  The graphic identity needed to convey friendliness and simplicity — a “you got this” feeling, if you will. We created a graphic identity for Rätt that can stand on its own, and also work beautifully alongside the existing Crusner brand.
 
  We incorporated illustrations and icons to help guide the user on their journey through legal questions and lawyer-lingo. All this to make sure clients and lawyers alike could breeze through their cases, in as breezy a manner as the law allows.

  ## Give it a spin

  Your very own lawyer is just an app download away. That’s pretty neat, no? Test out Rätt for yourself in their [web app](https://ratt.nu/), [on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/r%C3%A4tt/id1498087311) or [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rattapp).

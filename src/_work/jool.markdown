  The Scandinavian investment bank JOOL called us in to help them build a comprehensive online platform for investing in high-yield bonds. Working closely together over the course of a year, we did just that.

section1: |
  ### The investment portal takes shape.
  Previously, JOOL’s bond investment process was intensely paper-based. Faxing forms, emailing specs, keeping investors updated, and ensuring compliance all conspired to overload inboxes and filing cabinets.

 In collaboration with their technical back-office team, we built this new service from the ground up, transforming JOOL’s entire investment process into a digital one. We architected how the service would work, how the information is displayed, and how it all looks visually. For the database, we connected to an API built by FA Solutions in Finland.

section_3: |
  Onboarding needed to balance ease and thoroughness, both for the sake of potential investors and for JOOL. High-risk, high-reward investments aren’t for everyone, after all. In addition to a series of watertight verification measures, we architected a sorting process that uses questions and quizzes to gauge an investor’s experience level, as well as their aversion to risk.

section3: |
  The most experienced investor, at a score of 11, would be able to see all investments. Investors at a score of 6 or 7 could ask for counseling and would only be shown investments that presented lower risk. In layman’s terms: if you didn’t really know what you were doing, the platform would help you out.

  ### Bright and airy design
  When it came to the design of the user interface, we wanted to bring as much simplicity and legibility as we could to something that was already quite complex.

  We made good use of white space so it would be easy on the eyes and you would know where to focus at any given time. We also made careful decisions about how data would be displayed, as this type of information could easily turn into a sprawling mess of tables.

section5: |
  Saturated, bright colors and a whole new wardrobe of icons gives everything a modern touch. This was a new service after all, it needs to be serious, but it doesn’t need to be stiff.

  ## The many beauties of digitalization

section6: |
  JOOL saw the truth that many businesses are recognizing, and some are acting on. That information, when hoarded, becomes stagnant. It’s the very nature of information to be constantly moving, updating, changing – and shared.

  Digital portals like the one we built for JOOL open up direct, real-time channels for communication and changing information. For example, when JOOL brokers send an investment recommendation to a client through the portal, they can use automatic fields to fill in numerical information, pulled from the database. Their message remains updated and accurate down the krona, regardless of when it’s viewed.

section7: |
  From here? So much is possible. Having taken this massive step in digitalization, JOOL has opened the floodgates of opportunity and possibilities for itself.

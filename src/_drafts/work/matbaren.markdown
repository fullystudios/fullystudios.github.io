  Order management systems are famously awful. For the most part, they’re sad, grey C-Sharp concoctions from the 90s.

  Enter our client, Matbaren (or “Food Bar” in English).

  Matbaren supplies specially-made food carts to grocery stores all over Sweden. These are then stocked with high-quality food that can be eaten on the go. Store clerks decide which food to offer in the bar and place orders with Matbaren for delivery. 

  The supply chain looks like this:

  ## Matbaren gave us the literally awesome task of creating their order management system. 

  It needed to be an advanced store and a bookkeeping operation in one, featuring everything from price lists to newsfeeds, analytics and direct messages. Mainly, store clerks would use this to order their Matbaren packages for delivery, mixing and matching the foods they wanted from all the options available. 

  Moreover, there needed to be admins who could edit but not delete, and super admins with almighty powers. Real-time data would be converted into charts, and price changes would need to be reflected throughout the system in seconds. All of this needed to be presented in an easy-to-use dashboard, tailored to the specific needs of the user.

  ## The journey begins
  I was quite thrilled by the prospect of building something so big from the ground up. And something that would be so fundamentally useful for people on a daily basis. 

  My main priority was to make it fun -- a product that would be enjoyable to use. When you break it down, the formula goes something like this:  

  Fun = highly functional + really nice looking + something extra

  And if not “fun,” then at least entirely painless. Everyone interacting with a backend system wants to spend the least amount of time possible on it. This is often a good north star for design.

  ## PHP rangers
  The other (very) cool part of this project was that were given total design liberty. Meaning I could choose my own tools. I knew immediately I wanted to code with Laravel. 

  But before code we needed flow. Jonas (Fully’s front-end whisperer) and I took all the components that needed to be featured, drew up some flowcharts and sorted out the navigation. From there we organized the content and user privileges in Excel. 

  From there, fingers started to fly across keyboards. 

  Along the way, I added functionalities to make sure it would integrate seamlessly with the worklife of the user. A key feature was automatic saving, so if a store clerk is half-way through an order and has to leave the computer nothing gets lost.

  We also couldn’t help but make it beautiful. Solid information architecture was the first step here -- achieving “purity of function” as the designers say. The second step was all about well-chosen colors, pleasing fonts, and smart use of white space.

  ### A full-on service
  The system is now fully operative, with 200+ retailers using it every single day. That in itself is gratifying. It’s a delight to build an actual service for the web that people visit time and time again. 

  Because Matbaren’s business is growing, the number of users is escalating too. This steady increase demands more and more of the system, but we have it under control. The programming is solid so we’re easily able to add and change functions as needed.

  Brooklyn Brewery is a brewery based in New York, that in 2013 opened a branch in Stockholm - their second biggest market after New York itself. Since then it's been virtually impossible to go to a bar in Stockholm and not being able to enjoy their wide selection of refreshments.

  ### A space oddyssey
  To help them promote their new non-alcoholic beer 'Special Effects', as well as their collaboration with Göteborg Film Festival, we produced a branded content mini-series that went behind the scenes of Swedish space odyssey 'Aniara' to learn the tools of the trade of the film industry. Together with the agency Pronto, we developed the concept based on that simple question we all have sometimes - how did they do that?

section2: |
  Andreas Wicklund, VFX Supervisor for Aniara, walks us through how the Aniara ship is actually sort of based on a cruise ship, and how inspiration for the film’s AI came from a lamp.

  Calle Wachtmeister, Sound Supervisor Extraordinaire, shows us the smoke and mirrors of making a glove into butterflies, and how designing sound effects is sort of like being on stage.

  Maja-Stina Åsberg, one of the grand architects of production design for Aniara, takes us to her studio and talks about creativity and to be part of her dream project.
